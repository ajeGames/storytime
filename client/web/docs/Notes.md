# Parking Lot #

This area is for ideas to follow up on later -- not in the middle of whatever else I'm trying to accomplish.

* Get linter working in Atom and as part of test/build cycle.
* Automate deployment to S3.


# Decisions #

* Use create-react-app as long as possible
* Use eslint with airbnb-like rules in .eslintrc
* Use yarn
* Use react-router-dom
