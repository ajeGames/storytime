Storytime Application
=====================

This is the code to run the Storytime application, which consists of a backend server to manage stories and multiple
clients to enable users to interact with the system.  The server is a dropwizard application that offers a REST API, 
which is defined in a Swagger definition file, storytime-api.yaml.

This project offers its creator a means for staying current with software development, while continually 
getting sucked into the world of management where he works.  It is also meant to become a platform for bringing 
some fun to a weary world.  Good for other programmers who might want to learn from and improve upon what has been done, 
good for budding and experienced authors and illustrators who might enjoy creating multi-verse adventure stories, 
good for anyone who likes to read and explore new worlds.
